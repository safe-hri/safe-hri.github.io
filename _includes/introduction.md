Recent advances in ML have led to significant progress in robotics and robot learning. However, ensuring safety remains a key challenge in deploying robots in human environments. Physical safety (i.e., avoiding harmful contact) has traditionally been a focus in robotics, but effective human-robot interaction (HRI) also depends on broader safety dimensions. A growing body of work examines cognitive and social aspects of safetyâ€”robots can influence behavior in unintended ways, such as cognitive manipulation or social disruptions. Yet, physical, social, and cognitive safety are rarely studied together. 

Building on the first edition of this workshop, we now expand the discussion to include Foundation Models (FMs). Models like GPT and OpenVLA are increasingly applied in robotics for task planning, policy learning, and decision-making. Yet, they remain susceptible to issues such as hallucinations and jailbreaking, posing significant challenges for mission-critical applications (e.g., healthcare and disaster response). Robots can improve human safety by taking on dangerous tasks; however, when and how they should assume these roles remains an open question. As FMs find more widespread applications, ensuring both physical and perceived safety is critical. 

This workshop will explore safety and normative behaviors in real-world HRI, discussing methodologies, metrics, and modeling approaches. Our goal is to build a research community spanning robotics, HRI, foundation models, formal methods, human factors, and psychology. This full-day workshop is designed to start a thought-provoking conversation around safety and normative behaviors in HRI and foster interaction between researchers from different communities. The program reflects this objective by giving space to researchers in industry and academia from different seniority levels and research topics.
